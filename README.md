# Code-Quiz

## Description

I wanted to create a code quiz to help students test their knowledge under coding assessment conditions to replicate what that they will face as part of the interview process to land their first role in tech. 

This has been achieved by:
* Creating a timed quiz
* Displaying a question with multiple choice answers - once the question is answered, the next question & answers are displayed.
* If an incorrect answer is given, a time penalty of 10secs is taken off the timer.
* The quiz finishes when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
* The user can enter their initials to add their score to the Highscores page.
    * The user can clear the highscores page.

    

When clicking a correct answer - a 'correct' msg is displayed and a correct audio is played:

When clicking a wrong answer - a 'wrong' msg is displayed, time is reduced and an incorrect audio is played:

Submit button becomes disabled after score is submitted to highscores to prevent multiples of that score being added:
